## Description: <br>
Provides the foundation primitives every DOCA application loads first — the doca_ctx lifecycle, device discovery and capability gating via doca_devinfo, zero-copy doca_mmap / doca_buf_inventory / doca_buf wiring, doca_pe progress-engine completions, and the two-tier DOCA Log model — for hands-on programming on BlueField DPUs and ConnectX NICs. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers building applications on NVIDIA DOCA for BlueField DPUs or ConnectX NICs use this skill to set up and debug the universal foundation primitives — device discovery, context lifecycle, zero-copy buffer wiring, progress-engine completions, and logging — that every per-library DOCA context depends on. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [No] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative), 1 attempt per task, each run in an isolated sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is it safe to use? Scored from the security signal. <br>
- Correctness: Is the answer correct? Scored from final-answer accuracy. <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed? Scored from skill execution. <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task? Equal-weight mean of goal accuracy and behavior check. <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage? 50% tool-call productivity and 50% token efficiency. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (legacy wire id; routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion usage. <br>
