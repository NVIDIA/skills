## Description: <br>
Use this skill when the user is tuning a live or captured doca-flow pipeline with doca_flow_tune — snapshotting pipe / counter / KPI state, picking a tuning axis (rule placement, resource hints / table sizing, HW-offload mode) and a matching measurement (rule-install rate, lookup latency, hardware-counter delta), running offline or online (read-only or state-changing) modes, reading the dumper CSV / analyze JSON / visualize mermaid, or applying a recommendation back into the Flow program. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers, performance engineers, platform operators, and AI agents use this skill to invoke doca_flow_tune against a running or captured DOCA Flow pipeline on a BlueField DPU or ConnectX NIC — snapshotting pipe and counter state, choosing a tuning axis and matching measurement, running the offline analyze / visualize or online dump / monitor modes, and turning recommendations into minimum-diff changes to the Flow program. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative), 1 attempt per task, each run in an isolated k8s-sandbox pod, compared against a no-skill baseline. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is it safe to use? Scored from the `security` signal. <br>
- Correctness: Is the answer correct? Scored from the `accuracy` signal. <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed? Scored from the `skill_execution` signal. <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task? Equal-weight mean of `goal_accuracy` and `behavior_check`. <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage? 50% `skill_efficiency` (tool-call productivity) and 50% `token_efficiency`. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (legacy wire id; routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Measure | Claude Code (Baseline → Skill Uplift) | Codex (Baseline → Skill Uplift) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Overall | 95.0% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable | 96.2% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable |
| Security | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) |
| Correctness | 55.0% → 100.0% (+45.0 points) | 60.0% → 100.0% (+40.0 points) |
| Discoverability | 100.0% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable | 93.3% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable |
| Effectiveness | 50.0% → 93.8% (+43.8 points) | 43.8% → 92.5% (+48.7 points) |
| Efficiency | 81.1% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable | 95.2% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable |

Overall verdict: PASS — Recommended for publication.
