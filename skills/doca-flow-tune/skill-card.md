## Description: <br>
Use this skill when the user is tuning a live or captured `doca-flow` pipeline with `doca_flow_tune` — snapshotting pipe / counter / KPI state, picking a tuning axis (rule placement, resource hints / table sizing, HW-offload mode) and a matching measurement, running offline or online modes, reading the dumper CSV / analyze JSON / visualize mermaid, or applying a recommendation back into the Flow program. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External operators, performance engineers, DOCA Flow application developers, and AI agents use this skill to characterize, snapshot, analyze, visualize, and tune a running or captured `doca-flow` pipeline on their actual DOCA install and device, and to route tuning recommendations back into the Flow program. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative), each attempt run in its own isolated k8s sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is it safe to use? Checks unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Is the answer correct? Checks final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed, and were decoys avoided? <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task? Equal-weight mean of goal completion and expected workflow adherence. <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage? <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
