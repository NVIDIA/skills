## Description: <br>
Guides an agent to invoke the doca_flow_tune tool against a live or captured doca-flow pipeline — snapshotting pipe, counter, and KPI state, choosing a tuning axis (rule placement, resource hints / table sizing, HW-offload mode) with a matching measurement, running the monitor / analyze / visualize commands, interpreting their outputs, and applying recommendations back into the Flow program via minimum-diff, smoke-tested changes. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External operators, performance engineers, DOCA Flow application developers, and AI agents use this skill to characterize, dump, visualize, analyze, and tune a running doca-flow pipeline on their own DOCA install and BlueField or ConnectX device — capturing a read-only baseline, picking one tuning axis, and safely routing tuning recommendations back into the Flow application. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-5-5`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-6.1-sol`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative), one attempt per task, each attempt run in its own isolated k8s-sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is it safe to use? Checks unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Is the answer correct? Checks final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed, decoys avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task — equal-weight mean of goal completion and expected workflow adherence. <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage — tool-call productivity plus uncached token usage. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (legacy wire id; routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion usage (50% of Efficiency). <br>
