## Description: <br>
Use this skill for hands-on DOCA Ethernet packet-queue work on a BlueField DPU or ConnectX NIC — bringing up a `doca_eth_rxq` or `doca_eth_txq` on a port / representor / SF, picking among the four `enum doca_eth_rxq_type` values (`_REGULAR` / `_CYCLIC` / `_MANAGED_MEMPOOL` / `_SHARED_MEMPOOL`), sizing burst or scatter-gather length against the `_cap_*` queries, submitting `doca_eth_txq_task_send` / `_lso_send` send-tasks carrying packet `doca_buf`s, or debugging DOCA_ERROR_* returns from an Ethernet call. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External developers and engineers building applications that consume the DOCA Ethernet C library (directly or through FFI/bindings) to do line-rate packet I/O on physical ports, representors, or SFs of a BlueField or ConnectX device, including configuring, building, modifying, running, testing, and debugging RX/TX queue code. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative), 1 attempt per task, each run in an isolated k8s-sandbox pod, with and without the skill (baseline). <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill is safe to use — unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Whether the final answer is correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the right skill was loaded when needed — selection, decoy avoidance, and workflow execution. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the task (50% goal completion + 50% expected workflow adherence). <br>
- Efficiency: Whether wasted tool calls and token usage were avoided (50% tool-call productivity + 50% token efficiency). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion usage. <br>
