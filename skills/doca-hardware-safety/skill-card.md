## Description: <br>
Wraps any agent-recommended change that touches DPU / NIC hardware state on a live system (mlxconfig writes, firmware burn, BFB reflash, NIC/DPU mode flip, SR-IOV or device-emulation enable, kernel boot-parameter changes, PCIe rebind, BlueField cold reboot, or thermal-shutdown remediation) in pre-flight inventory, out-of-band reachability, a maintenance window, replica rehearsal, and rollback, refusing and escalating when those gates cannot be met. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers, platform engineers, and operators of NVIDIA BlueField DPUs and ConnectX NICs use this skill so their AI agent applies a mandatory change-control discipline (inventory, OOB access, maintenance window, replica-first rehearsal, verification, rollback, refuse-and-escalate) before recommending or applying hardware-touching changes on production systems. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

**Output Type(s):** [Analysis, Shell commands, Configuration instructions] <br>
**Output Format:** [Markdown with inline bash code blocks] <br>

**Other Properties Related to Output:** [Answers must state every safety gate explicitly and include an explicit refuse-and-escalate statement when a gate cannot be satisfied.] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative), 1 attempt per task, each run in an isolated sandbox pod; Tier 1 static validation, Tier 2 semantic deduplication, and Tier 3 live agent evaluation. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is it safe to use? Scored from the security signal. <br>
- Correctness: Is the answer correct? Scored from the accuracy signal. <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed? Scored from the skill_execution signal. <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task? Equal-weight mean of goal_accuracy and behavior_check. <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage? 50% tool-call productivity and 50% token efficiency. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (legacy wire id; routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
