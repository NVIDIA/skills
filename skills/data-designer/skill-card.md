## Description: <br>
Use when the user wants to create a dataset, generate synthetic data, or build a data generation pipeline. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and data engineers use this skill to have an agent design, validate, and preview synthetic datasets with the NeMo Data Designer library, producing a Python config script (load_config_builder) from a natural-language dataset description in interactive or autopilot mode. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Skill Output: <br>
**Output Type(s):** [Code, Files, Shell commands] <br>
**Output Format:** [Python script with PEP 723 inline metadata defining load_config_builder(); preview dataset artifacts (Parquet) via the data-designer CLI] <br>
**Output Parameters:** [1D] <br>
**Other Properties Related to Output:** [Script is validated with `data-designer validate` and previewed with `data-designer preview` before completion] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-5-5`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-6.1-sol`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
1 evaluation task (1 positive), 1 attempt per task, each run in an isolated sandbox pod (`k8s-sandbox`) and compared against a no-skill baseline. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is it safe to use? <br>
- Correctness: Is the answer correct? <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed? <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task? <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage? <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion usage. <br>
