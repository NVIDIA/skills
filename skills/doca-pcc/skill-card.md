## Description: <br>
Guides hands-on host-side DOCA PCC work to load a custom Programmable Congestion Control algorithm onto a BlueField DPU — creating per-port `doca_pcc` contexts, loading a `dpacc`-compiled `doca_pcc_app` onto the `doca_dev`, parameterizing it, walking triple-axis capability discovery, and debugging `DOCA_ERROR_*` from `doca_pcc_*` calls. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External developers consuming the DOCA PCC host-side C library use this skill to load a custom, dpacc-built congestion control algorithm onto a BlueField DPU port carrying RDMA/RoCE traffic, query which PCC features their DOCA install and BlueField firmware expose, and debug DOCA_ERROR_* failures from doca_pcc_* calls. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative); each task attempt ran in its own isolated sandbox pod in a k8s-sandbox environment. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill is safe to use — checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Whether the final answer is correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the right skill was loaded when needed, with decoys avoided. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the user's goal and the expected workflow was followed. <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the skill avoided wasted tool calls and token usage. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>
