## Description: <br>
Use this skill when producing a VSS analysis report — Mode A per-clip VLM, Mode B incident-range via video-analytics. Not for real-time alerts or ad-hoc Q&A. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 OR MIT <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers use this skill to generate structured video analysis reports from recorded clips (VLM-based) or incident time ranges (video-analytics-based) within VSS deployments. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
NVSkills-Eval 3-Tier Evaluation (profile: external, date: 2026-05-29). Tier 1 static validation and Tier 2 deduplication completed; Tier 3 live agent evaluation not available. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
