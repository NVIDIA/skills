## Description: <br>
Use to run top-level VSS fusion search on archived video, or to ingest video files / RTSP streams for search. <br>

This skill is for demonstration purposes and not for production usage. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache-2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers building video analytics applications who need to perform natural-language search across archived video content or ingest video files and RTSP streams for embedding-based retrieval. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Skill Output: <br>
**Output Type(s):** [API Calls, Shell commands, Analysis] <br>
**Output Format:** [Markdown with inline bash code blocks] <br>
**Output Parameters:** [1D] <br>
**Other Properties Related to Output:** [None] <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
3-Tier Evaluation via NVSkills-Eval (external profile). Tier 1 static validation ran 9 checks (3 LOW findings). Tier 2 deduplication ran 2 checks (0 findings). Tier 3 live agent evaluation was not available. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>
