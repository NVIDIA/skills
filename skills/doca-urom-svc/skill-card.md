## Description: <br>
Operate the DOCA UROM Service container on BlueField Arm to execute remote memory operations (puts, gets, atomics, collectives) enqueued by a paired host through the host-side `doca-urom` library. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External operators and platform teams use this skill to deploy and operate the DOCA UROM Service container on BlueField Arm — choosing which UCX components and collectives it exposes, sizing the enqueue queue depth, wiring DOCA Comch endpoint pairing with the host `doca-urom` library, and validating the host-library plus DPU-service paired contract before scaling HPC/UCX/MPI workloads. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-sonnet-5-5`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative), each attempt run in its own isolated k8s-sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill is safe to use, covering unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the expected skill was selected and activated when needed while decoys were avoided. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the user's goal and the expected workflow was followed (equal-weight mean of goal accuracy and behavior check). <br>
- Efficiency: Whether wasted tool calls and token usage were avoided (equal-weight mean of tool productivity and token efficiency). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (legacy wire id; routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
