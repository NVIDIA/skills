## Description: <br>
Guides launching and supervising a DOCA-linked binary directly on hardware (host x86 with a BlueField NIC over PCIe, or bare-metal on BlueField Arm) and diagnosing bare-metal launch, device-bind, co-tenant isolation, and BlueField lifecycle failures. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External DOCA developers and operators who have built a DOCA-linked application binary use this skill to run it directly on hardware (host x86 or BlueField Arm), choose a launch mode (direct, tmux, systemd), bind it to the correct PCIe function, NUMA node, CPU set, and IRQs, set up per-tenant isolation, and diagnose bare-metal launch and BlueField lifecycle failures. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-5-5`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-6.1-sol`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative), one attempt per task, each attempt run in its own isolated k8s-sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill is safe to use — unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Whether the final answer is correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the right skill was loaded when needed and decoys were avoided. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the user's goal and the expected workflow was followed. <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the run avoided wasted tool calls and token usage. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>
