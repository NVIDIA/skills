## Description: <br>
Defines the detect, prefer, fall back, and report contract plus locked JSON schemas (doca-env, version-matrix, capability-snapshot, validate-before-commit, and host/DPU collect-state) that other DOCA skills use to consolidate multi-command answers about DOCA environment, versions, devices, capabilities, and validation state, with manual command fallbacks when the structured helpers are absent. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers working with NVIDIA DOCA use this skill to get one-shot, consolidated answers about a host or BlueField DOCA install (environment, versions, devices, capabilities, pre-commit validation, host vs DPU state), preferring structured helper output when present and otherwise walking the documented manual command chains. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Reference(s): <br>
- [Worked routing examples](references/examples.md) <br>
- [NVIDIA DOCA SDK documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/sdk/index.html) <br>


## Skill Output: <br>
**Output Type(s):** [Analysis, Shell commands, Configuration instructions] <br>
**Output Format:** [Markdown with inline JSON schema fields and bash code blocks] <br>
**Output Parameters:** [1D] <br>
**Other Properties Related to Output:** [Answers open with a report of whether the structured helper or the manual fallback chain was used] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative) from skill-evaluator-dataset-snapshot/1, one attempt per task, each in an isolated sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the right skill was loaded when needed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the skill helped complete the task, via goal completion (50%) and expected workflow adherence (50%). <br>
- Efficiency: Checks for wasted tool calls and token usage, via tool-call productivity (50%) and token efficiency (50%). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (legacy wire id; routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Measure | Claude Code (Baseline → Skill Uplift) | Codex (Baseline → Skill Uplift) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Overall | 97.8% | 94.2% |
| Security | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) | 75.0% → 100.0% (+25.0 points) |
| Correctness | 75.0% → 100.0% (+25.0 points) | 85.0% → 90.0% (+5.0 points) |
| Discoverability | 100.0% | 95.0% |
| Effectiveness | 64.6% → 89.0% (+24.4 points) | 67.1% → 85.8% (+18.7 points) |
| Efficiency | 100.0% | 100.0% |
