## Description: <br>
Visual ChangeNet for binary image classification and segmentation in AOI defect detection. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers training, evaluating, exporting, and running inference on Visual ChangeNet models for binary image classification and change segmentation in PCB defect detection and AOI visual inspection workflows. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Optional] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [API key] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
1 evaluation task (1 positive) from skill-evaluator-dataset-snapshot/1, each attempt in an isolated sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the expected skill was found and executed when needed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks goal completion (goal_accuracy 50%) and expected workflow adherence (behavior_check 50%). <br>
- Efficiency: Checks routing quality, workspace-aware skill reads, and productive tool use. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was found and executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Routing quality, workspace-aware skill reads, and productive tool use. <br>
