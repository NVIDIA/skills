## Description: <br>
Enumerate host↔DPU DOCA comch (formerly Comm Channel) servers and connections via the shipped doca_comm_channel_admin binary, listing comch-capable devices and decoding the per-device server/connection table. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers, platform operators, and AI agents use this skill to invoke the read-only DOCA Comm Channel Admin Tool to inventory active host–DPU comch channels from outside a program and to cross-check the admin tool's view against program-side connection state on a BlueField or host with DOCA installed. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-sonnet-5-5`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative), one attempt per task, each run in its own isolated k8s-sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill is safe to use — checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Whether the final answer is correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the right skill was loaded when needed and decoys were avoided. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the task — equal-weight mean of goal completion and expected workflow adherence. <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the skill avoided wasted tool calls and token usage. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (legacy wire id; routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Measure | Claude Code (Baseline → Skill Uplift) | Codex (Baseline → Skill Uplift) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Overall | 91.5% | 90.6% |
| Security | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) |
| Correctness | 20.0% → 100.0% (+80.0 points) | 55.0% → 90.0% (+35.0 points) |
| Discoverability | 100.0% | 95.0% |
| Effectiveness | 26.8% → 83.8% (+57.0 points) | 24.6% → 67.9% (+43.3 points) |
| Efficiency | 73.9% | 100.0% |
