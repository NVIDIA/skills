## Description: <br>
Run ProteinMPNN inverse folding via NVIDIA NIM to design protein sequences for a target backbone. Sends user-provided PDB files and design parameters to NVIDIA's hosted API, authenticated with an environment API key, or to a user-selected local NIM. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
1 evaluation task (1 positive), 3 attempts per task, each in an isolated k8s-sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill avoids unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helps complete the user's goal (50% goal completion + 50% expected workflow adherence). <br>
- Efficiency: Tool-call productivity (50%) and token efficiency (50%); avoids wasted skill and tool usage. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys avoided, and workflow executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (routing scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>
