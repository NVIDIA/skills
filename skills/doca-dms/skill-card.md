## Description: <br>
Guides operating the NVIDIA DOCA Management Service (DMS) on a BlueField Arm, x86 host, or Kubernetes pod, covering the local dms-cli (DOCA 3.5+), bringing up the dmsd frontend and dmspe backend, choosing deployment shape and authentication mode, configuring -allowed_users and dmsgroup, issuing gNMI Get/Set and supported gNOI operations behind a target-bound confirmation gate for destructive actions, and debugging frontend-versus-backend failures and logs. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External operators and platform teams use this skill to manage NVIDIA BlueField and ConnectX targets from a centralized control plane: deciding where DMS should run, launching and authenticating dmsd, reading and setting YANG-modeled configuration through dms-cli or gNMI, running gNOI workflows such as reboot, OS install, file transfer, and mlxconfig with explicit confirmation, and diagnosing failed requests, logs, and persistency issues. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Optional] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [Other [Basic auth], Other [mTLS client certificate]] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-5-5`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-6.1-sol`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative), one attempt per task, each in an isolated k8s-sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill is safe to use, checking for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Whether the final answer is correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the expected skill was loaded when needed and decoys were avoided. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the task, as the equal-weight mean of goal completion and expected-workflow adherence. <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the skill avoided wasted tool calls and token usage, as the equal-weight mean of tool-call productivity and token efficiency. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>
