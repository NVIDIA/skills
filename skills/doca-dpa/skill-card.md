## Description: <br>
Guides hands-on host-side DOCA DPA work on a BlueField DPU: creating the doca_dpa context, loading a DPACC-compiled DPA application image, creating DPA threads, launching kernels via doca_dpa_kernel_launch_update_*, draining doca_dpa_completion, running doca_dpa_cap_* discovery, choosing between the DPA comm and DPA verbs components, and debugging DOCA_ERROR_* from doca_dpa_* calls. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External developers and engineers building host-side applications that consume the DOCA DPA library use this skill to stand up the doca_dpa context, load a dpacc-built DPA application image, launch DPA kernels, drain completions, query DPA capabilities, and debug DPA-related DOCA errors (including DOCA/DPACC version skew) on BlueField DPUs. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-5-5`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-6.1-sol`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative), one attempt per task, each run in an isolated k8s-sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is the skill safe to use (unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access). <br>
- Correctness: Is the final answer correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed and were decoys avoided. <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task (equal-weight mean of goal completion and expected workflow adherence). <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage (tool-call productivity and token efficiency). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (legacy wire id; routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion usage (50% of Efficiency). <br>
