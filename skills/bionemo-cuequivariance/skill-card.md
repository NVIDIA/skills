## Description: <br>
Use when defining cuEquivariance groups and irreps, building equivariant tensor products, or validating segmented polynomials with NumPy. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers building geometric (equivariant) neural networks use this skill to define custom groups and irreps, build segmented tensor products with Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, use built-in descriptors, and validate equivariant polynomials with NumPy on CPU. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [No] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-5-5`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-6.1-sol`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
6 evaluation tasks (5 positive, 1 negative), 1 attempt per task, each run in its own isolated sandbox pod (`k8s-sandbox` environment); each task was also attempted without the skill as a baseline. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is it safe to use? Scored from `security` (100%). <br>
- Correctness: Is the answer correct? Scored from `accuracy` (100%). <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed? Scored from `skill_execution` (100%). <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task? Scored from `goal_accuracy` (50%) + `behavior_check` (50%). <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage? Scored from `skill_efficiency` (50%) + `token_efficiency` (50%). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (legacy wire id; routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion usage (50% of Efficiency). <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
**Overall verdict:** ✅ PASS — Recommended for publication

**Publication Recommendation:** Recommended for publication based on the completed evaluation evidence in this report.

### Results at a Glance

| Measure | Claude Code (Baseline → Skill Uplift) | Codex (Baseline → Skill Uplift) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Overall | 75.1% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable | 80.5% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable |
| Security | 83.3% → 33.3% (-50.0 points) | 100.0% → 75.0% (-25.0 points) |
| Correctness | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) | 100.0% → 96.7% (-3.3 points) |
| Discoverability | 84.0% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable | 83.0% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable |
| Effectiveness | 95.8% → 91.7% (-4.1 points) | 74.2% → 79.6% (+5.4 points) |
| Efficiency | 66.3% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable | 68.1% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable |

Baseline is the same task attempted without the target skill. Scores are rounded to one decimal; threshold-adjacent values use additional precision so their displayed band matches the verdict. Uplift is derived from those displayed scores and shown in percentage points. A partial dimension was calculated from only the available configured signals.

### Comparison details

Shared-source comparisons use the same signals and weights on both conditions. They do not replace the full dimension scores above or change the publication verdict.

| Agent | Dimension | Basis | Baseline → With skill (uplift) | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| claude-code | Discoverability | Dimension comparison | N/A | Discoverability is not applicable to the no-skill baseline; there is no installed skill to discover. |
| claude-code | Efficiency | Token-only comparison | 87.7% → 86.7% (-1.0 points) | Only Token Efficiency is comparable; the full dimension scores use different evaluator sources. |
| codex | Discoverability | Dimension comparison | N/A | Discoverability is not applicable to the no-skill baseline; there is no installed skill to discover. |
| codex | Efficiency | Token-only comparison | 78.6% → 82.9% (+4.3 points) | Only Token Efficiency is comparable; the full dimension scores use different evaluator sources. |

### Tier Status

| Tier | Purpose | Status | Evidence |
