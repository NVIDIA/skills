## Description: <br>
Generate novel drug-like molecules using the GenMol NIM microservice for de novo generation, scaffold decoration, motif extension, lead optimization, QED or LogP ranking, hosted NVIDIA API calls, or local Docker deployment. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache-2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and computational chemists use this skill to generate novel drug-like molecules for early-stage drug discovery workflows, including de novo generation, scaffold decoration, motif extension, and lead optimization with QED or LogP ranking. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Yes] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
1 evaluation task (1 positive), 3 attempts per task, evaluated in isolated k8s-sandbox pods. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the expected skill was selected and the workflow executed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the user's goal was achieved and expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks tool-call productivity and token efficiency. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys avoided, and workflow executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>
