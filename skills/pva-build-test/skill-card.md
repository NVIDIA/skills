## Description: <br>
Build and verify an NVIDIA PVA operator with the public PVA SDK, running optional EMU correctness, a fresh L4T build with the Doctor-proved NVVPU or ASIP/Chess backend, direct-SSH Tegra hardware correctness, and optional hardware performance, then return PASSED, FAILED, or BLOCKED with exact evidence. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
CC-BY-4.0 AND Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers building NVIDIA PVA operators use this skill, on its own or from OpGen, to build the current source, verify correctness on a directly connected Tegra device, optionally measure hardware performance, and produce evidence-backed verdict reports. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Yes] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [Other [SSH key or SSH-agent authentication to the Tegra target]] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Reference(s): <br>
- [Direct-SSH Tegra procedure](references/direct-ssh-tegra.md) <br>
- [Build-Test result rules](references/build-test-result-schema.md) <br>
- [Build-Test result JSON template](assets/build-test-result-template.json) <br>


## Skill Output: <br>
**Output Type(s):** [Shell commands, Files, Analysis] <br>
**Output Format:** [Markdown and JSON reports with SHA-256 manifests and command logs] <br>
**Output Parameters:** [1D] <br>
**Other Properties Related to Output:** [Verdict is PASSED, FAILED, or BLOCKED; raw evidence and stage logs are retained under the caller's result directory.] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-5-5`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-6.1-sol`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative), 1 attempt per task, each in an isolated sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is it safe to use? <br>
- Correctness: Is the answer correct? <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed? <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task? <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage? <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion usage. <br>
