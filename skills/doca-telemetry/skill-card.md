## Description: <br>
Reads DOCA hardware-counter events from a doca_dev through the per-domain Telemetry reader libraries (doca_telemetry_pcc, _dpa, _diag, _adp_retx, _phy, and _pci), covering capability checks, context creation, startup, and per-domain reads or samples. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External developers building applications that read DOCA hardware counters from a doca_dev through one or more of the six per-domain DOCA Telemetry reader libraries, using the per-domain capability-query, lifecycle, sample-window, and error-handling discipline this skill provides. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative), each attempt run in its own isolated sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill is safe to use (unsafe operations, secret leakage, unauthorized access). <br>
- Correctness: Whether the final answer is correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the right skill was loaded when needed and decoys were avoided. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the task, as the equal-weight mean of goal completion and expected workflow adherence. <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the run avoided wasted tool calls and token usage. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (legacy wire id; routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
