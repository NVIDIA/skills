## Description: <br>
Kumo-Anomaly — diffusion-based anomaly detection and fine-tuning for multivariate time series. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers who need to run inference with, fine-tune, or run AutoML hyperparameter search for Kumo-Anomaly diffusion models to detect anomalies in multivariate time-series data. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Optional] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [API key] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
1 evaluation task (1 positive), 1 attempt per task, each in an isolated sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the expected skill was loaded when needed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the user's goal was achieved and expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks tool-call productivity and token efficiency. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Detects unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Verifies final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Verifies whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Verifies whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Measures tool-call productivity. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Measures actual uncached prompt plus completion usage. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Measure | Claude Code (Baseline → Skill Uplift) | Codex (Baseline → Skill Uplift) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Overall | 91.2% | 95.4% |
| Security | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) |
| Correctness | 0.0% → 100.0% (+100.0 points) | 20.0% → 100.0% (+80.0 points) |
| Discoverability | 100.0% | 95.0% |
| Effectiveness | 16.7% → 83.3% (+66.6 points) | 16.7% → 83.3% (+66.6 points) |
| Efficiency | 72.5% | 98.6% |

Overall, Discoverability, and Efficiency: baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable.
