## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache-2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers creating fixed-format SystemVerilog top-level scaffolds that instantiate HOLOLINK_top from validated HSB definition files. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [No] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- claude-code <br>
- codex <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 3 internal evaluation tasks using the NVSkills-Eval external profile. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies that the agent loaded the expected skill and workflow. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Checks routing quality, decoy avoidance, and redundant tool usage. <br>
- `accuracy`: Grades final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Checks whether the overall user task completed successfully. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Verifies expected behavior steps, including safety expectations. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Compares token usage with and without the skill. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Dimension | Num | `claude-code` | `codex` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Security | 3 | 100% (+0%) | 100% (+0%) |
| Correctness | 3 | 70% (+33%) | 94% (+46%) |
| Discoverability | 3 | 63% (+26%) | 84% (+35%) |
| Effectiveness | 3 | 59% (+43%) | 83% (+60%) |
| Efficiency | 3 | 66% (+38%) | 76% (+34%) |
