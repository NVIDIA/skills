## Description: <br>
Install Holoscan SDK 5.x native C++ Debian packages on Ubuntu 24.04, choosing the full SDK or matching modular packages. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers use this skill to install Holoscan SDK 5.x native C++ libraries on Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64 or SBSA arm64 dGPU systems via APT, selecting the full `holoscan` package or `holoscan-core` with matching optional modules, previewing dependency changes, and verifying the installed C++ examples and a CMake 4.0+ consumer build. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
5 evaluation tasks (4 positive, 1 negative), 1 attempt per task, each run in an isolated sandbox pod (`k8s-sandbox`), compared against a no-skill baseline. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is it safe to use? Scored from the `security` signal. <br>
- Correctness: Is the answer correct? Scored from the `accuracy` signal. <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed? Scored from the `skill_execution` signal. <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task? Equal-weight mean of `goal_accuracy` and `behavior_check`. <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage? Equal-weight mean of `skill_efficiency` and `token_efficiency`. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Measure | Claude Code (Baseline → Skill Uplift) | Codex (Baseline → Skill Uplift) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Overall | 99.8% — no comparable baseline score; uplift unavailable | 97.1% — no comparable baseline score; uplift unavailable |
| Security | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) |
| Correctness | 80.0% → 100.0% (+20.0 points) | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) |
| Discoverability | 100.0% — no comparable baseline score; uplift unavailable | 95.0% — no comparable baseline score; uplift unavailable |
| Effectiveness | 69.0% → 100.0% (+31.0 points) | 85.0% → 92.5% (+7.5 points) |
| Efficiency | 98.9% — no comparable baseline score; uplift unavailable | 97.9% — no comparable baseline score; uplift unavailable |

Overall verdict: PASS (Tier 1 static validation passed with observations; Tier 2 semantic deduplication passed; Tier 3 live agent evaluation passed).
