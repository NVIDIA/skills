## Description: <br>
Multi-step video annotation pipeline that turns raw videos into Chain-of-Thought training data — multi-level captions, structured descriptions, and QA pairs (MCQ, binary, open-ended) with reasoning traces, via VLM/LLM distillation. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
1 evaluation task (1 positive case) on the trusted local host. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the right skill was found and executed when needed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the skill helped complete the user’s goal and expected workflow. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks routing quality, workspace-aware skill reads, and productive tool use. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was found and executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Routing quality, workspace-aware skill reads, and productive tool use. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user’s goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
