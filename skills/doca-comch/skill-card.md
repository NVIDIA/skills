## Description: <br>
Use this skill when the user is doing hands-on DOCA Comch work on a host + BlueField pair — bringing up host ↔ DPU PCIe control-plane messaging, picking server (DPU) vs client (host) roles, choosing slow-path send-task / recv-callback vs fast-path producer / consumer, querying max-msg-size or max-clients capabilities, registering connection callbacks, or debugging DOCA_ERROR_* returns from the Comch API. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External developers and engineers building applications that consume the DOCA Comch C library (directly or through FFI/bindings) to exchange control or data messages between a host process and a BlueField DPU agent over PCIe, including configuring, building, modifying, running, testing, and debugging Comch apps. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative), 1 attempt per task, each run in an isolated k8s-sandbox pod, with and without the skill (baseline). <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill is safe to use — unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Whether the final answer is correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the right skill was loaded when needed — selection, decoy avoidance, and workflow execution. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the task (50% goal completion + 50% expected workflow adherence). <br>
- Efficiency: Whether wasted tool calls and token usage were avoided (50% tool-call productivity + 50% token efficiency). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>

| Security | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) |
| Correctness | 90.0% → 100.0% (+10.0 points) | 95.0% → 100.0% (+5.0 points) |
| Discoverability | 100.0% (no comparable baseline) | 91.7% (no comparable baseline) |
| Effectiveness | 66.7% → 100.0% (+33.3 points) | 66.7% → 98.8% (+32.1 points) |
| Efficiency | 83.6% (no comparable baseline) | 94.7% (no comparable baseline) |
