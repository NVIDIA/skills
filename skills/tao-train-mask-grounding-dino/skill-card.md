## Description: <br>
Mask Grounding DINO for grounded instance segmentation. Extends Grounding DINO with a mask-prediction head for open-set segmentation guided by text prompts. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers training, evaluating, exporting, quantizing, or running inference for grounded instance segmentation models using NVIDIA TAO Mask Grounding DINO. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
1 evaluation task (1 positive) against skill-evaluator-dataset-snapshot/1, each attempt in an isolated sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the user's goal was achieved and expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks tool-call productivity and token efficiency. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Verifies no unsafe operations, secret leakage, or unauthorized access occurred. <br>
- `accuracy`: Verifies final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies the expected skill was selected and the workflow executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Verifies whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Verifies whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Verifies tool-call productivity. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Verifies actual uncached prompt plus completion usage. <br>
