## Description: <br>
Guides hands-on DOCA GPUNetIO programming on an NVIDIA GPU paired with a BlueField DPU or ConnectX NIC: wiring a CUDA kernel to a doca-eth queue via doca_gpu_eth_rxq / doca_gpu_eth_txq, standing up the per-CUDA-device doca_gpu context, designing the persistent CUDA kernel that drains the GPU-visible queue, running the dual capability check (DOCA cap-query plus cudaGetDeviceProperties), registering cudaMalloc pools via doca_buf_arr_create_*, and debugging DOCA_ERROR_* returns from the GPUNetIO API. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External developers and engineers building applications that consume the DOCA GPUNetIO library use this skill to stand up a doca_gpu context and GPU-visible RX/TX queues on top of DOCA Ethernet, write persistent CUDA kernels that process packets directly on the GPU, check whether a given GPU and DOCA/CUDA combination supports GPUNetIO, register CUDA-allocated buffers with DOCA, and work out which layer (DOCA, CUDA, GPUDirect RDMA, or doca-eth) caused a GPUNetIO-related DOCA error. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-5-5`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-6.1-sol`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative), one attempt per task, each run in an isolated k8s-sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is the skill safe to use (unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access). <br>
- Correctness: Is the final answer correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed and were decoys avoided. <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task (equal-weight mean of goal completion and expected workflow adherence). <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage (tool-call productivity and token efficiency). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (legacy wire id; routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion usage. <br>
