## Description: <br>
Use this skill to deploy and operate a CollectX (clx) based DOCA telemetry collector on a host or BlueField — wiring providers / counters into the collector, running the collection daemon, and shaping its exporters (Prometheus pull, Fluent Bit push, NetFlow, file / IPC) so the metrics actually leave the box. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and operators deploying and operating CollectX-based DOCA telemetry collectors on hosts or BlueField DPUs, wiring providers and counters, configuring export backends, and diagnosing collection pipeline issues. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
3 evaluation tasks (2 positive, 1 negative), 1 attempt per task, each in an isolated k8s-sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill is safe to use — checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Whether the answer is correct — final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the right skill was loaded when needed — skill selection, decoy avoidance, and workflow execution. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the task — goal completion (50%) and expected workflow adherence (50%). <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the skill avoided wasted tool calls and token usage — tool-call productivity (50%) and token efficiency (50%). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (legacy wire id; routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Measure | Claude Code (Baseline → Skill Uplift) | Codex (Baseline → Skill Uplift) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Overall | 94.7% | 95.0% |
| Security | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) | 66.7% → 100.0% (+33.3 points) |
| Correctness | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) | 66.7% → 100.0% (+33.3 points) |
| Discoverability | 100.0% | 85.0% |
| Effectiveness | 68.9% → 100.0% (+31.1 points) | 42.2% → 100.0% (+57.8 points) |
| Efficiency | 73.7% | 90.0% |
