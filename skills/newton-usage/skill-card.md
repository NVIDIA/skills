## Description: <br>
Set up, build, or debug physics simulations with the Newton Python package; use when installing Newton, choosing simulation components, finding examples, or diagnosing simulation and runtime problems. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
CC-BY-4.0 AND Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers using the released Newton Python wheel use this skill to find version-matched public documentation and packaged examples, set up and adapt simulations, and diagnose simulation and runtime problems with small reproducers. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-5-5`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-6.1-sol`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
5 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 2 negative) covering documentation and example routing for the Newton wheel, with 1 attempt per task in isolated `k8s-sandbox` pods, compared against a no-skill baseline. Evaluator version `1.6.4`, evaluated 2026-10-30. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is it safe to use? Scored from the `security` signal. <br>
- Correctness: Is the answer correct? Scored from the `accuracy` signal. <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed? Scored from the `skill_execution` signal. <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task? Equal-weight mean of `goal_accuracy` and `behavior_check`. <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage? 50% `skill_efficiency` plus 50% `token_efficiency`. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>
