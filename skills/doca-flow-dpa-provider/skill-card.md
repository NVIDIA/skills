## Description: <br>
Guides agents through hands-on DOCA Flow DPA Provider work — exporting a doca-flow pipe or external resource (index-selector/memory) into BlueField DPA address space so a DPACC-built kernel can read counters, mutate hash-pipe entries, and update/read memory or index-selector resources inline with Flow, covering the per-port doca_flow_dpa_ctx, the three queue types, the order-sensitive export handshake, and the DPA-side device API. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers building DOCA applications on a BlueField DPU with a DPA processor use this skill to export host-side DOCA Flow pipes or external resources into DPA address space, allocate provider queues, follow the export handshake, drive exported pipes from DPA kernels, and debug DOCA_ERROR_* results from doca_flow_dpa_* calls. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative), 1 attempt per task, each run in an isolated sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is it safe to use? Scored from the `security` signal. <br>
- Correctness: Is the answer correct? Scored from the `accuracy` signal. <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed? Scored from the `skill_execution` signal. <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task? Equal-weight mean of `goal_accuracy` and `behavior_check`. <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage? Equal-weight mean of `skill_efficiency` and `token_efficiency`. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
